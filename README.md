Earthquakes are the result of suden energy in the Earth's crust, and many people worldwide fear the idea of seisimc activity destroying their beloved area where they reside.

## Purpose

The subject of Earthquakes hits close to home since it demolished the area that my parents once called home. Haiti is the name of that demolished nation.

Iâ€™m excited to learn about using Git and GitHub in a classroom setting.
