#Visual Style 1

###Pros

- The red colours are very approppriate since they represent the nature of emergency
- The typeface *Franchise* is bold and is great for representing importance
- The bucket designs are clean looking

###Cons

- The button is a little more basic then I would have wanted
- The images can be traumatic for the sensitive

#Visual Style 2

###Pros

- Great images that reflect the tragic nature of natural disasters but at the same time, not too graphic for the sensitive viewers
- The main font used, which is *Edmonsans* is very clean and can be used in great typographic situations

###Cons

- The colours do not suggest the tragic and dangerous nature of an earthquake
- The main font is a little too slim for displaying importance of the subject

#Visual Style 3

###Pros

- The main font is very clean, and well structured for a website
- The colours of red and orange suggest danger, threat and importance
- The texture displays danger and importance being the colour of red, and also is very subtle.
- 
###Cons

- Bucket could have more design aspects to them
- The button's colour is a bit off, a darker colour would be prefered




#Final words

This visual style 1 is the best direction because it is great for letting people know how serious an earthquake really is, because the colours and bold fonts truly reflect the urgency of this natural disasters. Although the pictures may be semi graphic for the sensitive, I feel that the truth should always be exposed in order to let people know the true magnitude of a situation.
