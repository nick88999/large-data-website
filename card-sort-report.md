## Observations

- The participants both thought that my cards were fairly easy to categorize. 
- They had no questions that stood out, they both just got to work with the categorizing and had a fairly easy time with it.
- Only slight struggle was with Sylvia when she thought that intraplate earthquakes and interplate earthquakes were in a category of their own, when in reality it is just a type of earthquake like supershear earthquakes, tsunami earthquakes, underwater earthquakes etc.
- They did not seem to find common grouping, so I feel like I made the card sort very clear to categorize.
- There did not seem to be any groupings that were unexpected
- The results were almost exactly as I expected, except for Sylvia's confusion with intraplate earthquakes and interplate earthquakes.
- I felt like I had done a pretty decent job at making the categories easy to sort since they had my card sorting completed fairly fast.
