             <p> <strong> What Causes an Earthquake? </strong> </p> 
        </div>
        
        <div class="body">
            <p> The shaking motion of an earthquake is the result of a sudden release of energy. Earthquakes are caused when stress, building up within rocks of the earth's crust, is released in a sudden jolt. Rocks crack and slip past each other causing the ground to vibrate. Cracks along which rocks slip are called faults. They may break through the ground surface, or be deep within the earth. The location on a fault where slip first occurs is called the focus, whereas the position directly above it on the ground surface is called the epicentre. </p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="body2">
        	<p>The size of an earthquake depends on the size of the fault and the amount of slip on the fault, but that’s not something scientists can simply measure with a measuring tape since faults are many kilometers deep beneath the earth’s surface. So how do they measure an earthquake? They use the seismogram recordings made on the seismographs at the surface of the earth to determine how large the earthquake was (figure 5). </p> </div>

             <p> <strong> Can scientists predict earthquakes? </strong> </p> 
        </div>
        
        <div class="body3">
            <p> No, and it is unlikely they will ever be able to predict them. Scientists have tried many different ways of predicting earthquakes, but none have been successful. On any particular fault, scientists know there will be another earthquake sometime in the future, but they have no way of telling when it will happen. </p>

             <p> <strong>How are earthquakes recorded? </strong> </p> 
        </div>
        
        <div class="body4">
            <p> Earthquakes are recorded by instruments called seismographs. The recording they make is called a seismogram. (figure 4) The seismograph has a base that sets firmly in the ground, and a heavy weight that hangs free. When an earthquake causes the ground to shake, the base of the seismograph shakes too, but the hanging weight does not. Instead the spring or string that it is hanging from absorbs all the movement. The difference in position between the shaking part of the seismograph and the motionless part is what is recorded. </p>

            <p>An earthquake may cause injury and loss of life, road and bridge damage, general property damage (which may or may not be covered by earthquake insurance), and collapse or destabilization (potentially leading to future collapse) of buildings. The aftermath may bring disease, lack of basic necessities, and higher insurance premiums. </p>

             <p> <strong> Earthquake Safety Tips </strong> </p> 
        </div>
        
        <div class="body6">
            <p> Earthquakes are a common occurrence, rumbling below Earth's surface thousands of times every day. But major earthquakes are less common. Here are some things to do to prepare for an earthquake: have an earthquake readiness plan, consult a professional to learn how to make your home sturdier such as bolting bookcases to wall studs or installing strong latches on cupboards, locate a place in each room of the house that you can go to where nothing is likely to fall on you in case of an earthquake, keep a supply of canned food, an up-to-date first aid kit, 3 gallons (11.4 liters) of water per person, dust masks and goggles, and a working battery-operated radio and flashlights, and know how to turn off your gas and water mains. </p>
